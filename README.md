# MinigameCore

This plugin is meant to be a framework for creating minigames, I made it because
after rewriting this exact code for the 30th time, I decided it was time to make
a framework for it.

This was made for me, and the target audience is myself, but if you want to use it,
go ahead! I don't mind at all, but support will be limited. I will have a tiny
explanation of the code in a comment above each class (like this one), but they
won't be very in-depth.
